All code is preset to webcam on your computer.

#hand_Mouse
This code tracks your hand and with it, controls your cursor on the screen
The code is made in Python
The code will be very slow on some computers so to counter this, the smoothness of the cursor has been reduced
Your hand must be inside the rectangle shown on the popup to control your cursor. Think of it like a trackpad.
Index finger up to move the cursor around
Thumb and index finger have to touch to click on the screen
Index, middle and ring fingers up scrolls up
Index, middle, ring and pinky up to scroll down

#minecraft_Movements
Lift only index finger on your right hand to control the way you look
Left hand controls all other controls.
I'm adding more gestures to move your character and fully play the game.
IMPORTANT: Might not work in some versions due to backend issues. Works in Java edition, maybe in Bedrock edition
I'll try to figure out ways so that you can play in any version.
Lot's of comments and more to come!

#Fruit Ninja
Lift your index finger up and your cursor will follow it. Use this to cut fruits!
